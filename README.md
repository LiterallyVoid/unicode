# Unicode

Separate text into graphemes, codepoints, UTF-16 code units, and UTF-8 code units. Delete individual codepoints to see how graphemes boil and shift, bending to your will.

To store codepoint names, I wrote my own binary format. <https://github.com/LiterallyVoid/unicode-character-names-binary>
